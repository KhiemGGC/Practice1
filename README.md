# Homemade Pizza Recipe

## Ingredients

### Dough
- 2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
- 1 1/2 cups warm water (110°F)
- 3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp sugar

### Sauce
- 1 can (15 oz) tomato sauce
- 1 can (6 oz) tomato paste
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp dried basil
- 1/2 tsp sugar
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Toppings
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- Your favorite toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, etc.)

## Instructions

### Dough
1. In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it stand until frothy, about 10 minutes.
2. In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.
3. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 6-8 minutes, until smooth and elastic.
4. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.

### Sauce
1. In a medium saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant.
2. Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, oregano, basil, sugar, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.

### Assembly
1. Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C).
2. Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal parts. Roll each part into a circle on a floured surface.
3. Place the dough on a pizza stone or baking sheet. Spread a layer of sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
4. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the sauce, then add your favorite toppings.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
6. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.

Enjoy your homemade pizza!
